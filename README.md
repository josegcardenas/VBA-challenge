# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this homework assignment you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.
### Analysis

1.  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the ticker symbol.

2.  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3.  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

* The solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* We made the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
